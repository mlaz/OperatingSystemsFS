/**
 *  \file sofs_syscalls_others.c (implementation file for a number of syscalls)
 *
 *  \brief Set of operations to manage system calls.
 *
 *         The aim is to provide an unique description of the functions that operate at this level.
 *
 *  The operations are:
 *      \li mount the SOFS10 file system
 *      \li unmount the SOFS10 file system
 *      \li get file system statistics
 *      \li get file status
 *      \li check real user's permissions for a file
 *      \li change permissions of a file
 *      \li change the ownership of a file
 *      \li make a new name for a file
 *      \li delete the name of a file from a directory and possibly the file it refers to from the file system
 *      \li change the name or the location of a file in the directory hierarchy of the file system
 *      \li create a regular file with size 0
 *      \li open a regular file
 *      \li close a regular file
 *      \li read data from an open regular file
 *      \li write data into an open regular file
 *      \li synchronize a file's in-core state with storage device
 *      \li create a directory
 *      \li delete a directory
 *      \li open a directory for reading
 *      \li read a direntry from a directory
 *      \li close a directory
 *      \li make a new name for a regular file or a directory
 *      \li read the value of a symbolic link.
