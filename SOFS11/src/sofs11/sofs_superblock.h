 *  It is divided in:
 *     \li <em>header</em> - that contains data about the type, the version, the name, the size in number of physical
 *         blocks and the consistency status
 *     \li <em>inode table metadata</em> - concerning its location, size in number of blocks in use and inodes and
 *         number of free inodes; the inode table is primarily conceived as an array of inodes, however, the free inodes
 *         form a double-linked list whose location of the head and the tail are also provided (dynamic FIFO that links
 *         together, using the inodes themselves as nodes, all the free inodes)
 *     \li <em>data zone metadata</em> - concerning its location, size in total number of data clusters, number of free
 *         data clusters and its three main reference components: the insertion and retrieval caches for an easy access
 *         temporary storage of references (static structures resident within the superblock itself) and the location
 *         of the head and the tail of the general repository of free data clusters double-linked list (dynamic FIFO
 *         that links together, using the data  clusters themselves as nodes, all the free data clusters whose
 *         references are not in the above mentioned caches).
